**Chapter 4  Having fun with functional data structures**


This chapter covers
- Introducing type parameterization with covariance and contravariance
- Having fun with higher-order functions
- Creating your own function objects in Scala
- Introducing the Scala collection hierarchy and parallel collections

To understand and benefit from Scala collections, you need to know two concepts:
1. type parameterization 
1. higher-order functions.

# 4.1 Introducing type parameterization
For this section, forget that Scala provides an Option type so that you can build something similar on your own. You’ll create a function that will return the index position of an element in a list.
```scala
scala> def position[A](xs:List[A], value:A):Int = {
     |   xs.indexOf(value)
     | }
position: [A](xs: List[A], value: A)Int

scala> position(List(1,2,3,4,5),4)
res1: Int = 3

scala> position(List("a","b","c"),"b")
res3: Int = 1

scala> val xs = List("one", "two", "three")
xs: List[String] = List(one, two, three)

scala> position(xs, "two")
res4: Int = 1

scala> val ys = List(20, 30, 40)
ys: List[Int] = List(20, 30, 40)

scala> position(ys, 40)
res5: Int = 2

scala> position[Int](ys, 300)
res6: Int = -1
```


Currently your position function returns `-1` when there’s no matching element. Here, instead of returning the Int result, you’ll return a new type that clearly expresses the behavior of the method. You’ll create a container called `Maybe` that will wrap the result. Your `position` method will look like this:
