# [Foreword](ch00.md)

# Part I Scala: the basics
## [1. Why Scala?](ch01.md)
In irst Scala things in first. Action, chapter 1 focuses on Scala and why you should pick it as your next language.

Scala is one of those rare languages that successfully integrates both object-oriented and functional language features. This makes it powerful because it gives you more in your toolbox to solve programming problems. 

## [2. Getting Started](ch02.md)
Chapter 2 stays within the middle of the road, helping you become comfortable with the basics of Scala and its environment so you can start working with it and writing Scala programs. 

## [3. OOP in Scala](ch03.md)
Chapter 3 introduces the object-oriented features of Scala, including some not available in other statically typed languages.

You’ll build a Scala driver for MongoDB, a scalable document-oriented database. You’ll build this driver incrementally using the object-oriented constructs provided by Scala. You’ll explore how to use traits when building Scala applications, and learn about the importance of Scala case classes.

## [4. Functional data structures](ch04.md)
You’ll learn Scala collections, which broadly support two categories of data structures—immutable and mutable.

## [5. Functional Programming](ch05.md)

Focuses on functional programming, although you’ve been doing functional programming if you’ve been following the examples in the book. In some cases functional programming is obvious; other times it is mixed with object-oriented constructs of Scala. The chapter also touches on monads and practical examples.
