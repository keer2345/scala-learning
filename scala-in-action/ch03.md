**Chapter 3 OOP in Scala**


This chapter covers
- Building a MongoDB driver using Scala classes and traits
- Pattern matching with case classes
- Looking into named and default arguments

In this chapter you’ll build a Scala driver for [MongoDB](www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home). MongoDB is a scalable, document-oriented database. You’ll build this driver incrementally using the object-oriented constructs provided by Scala, and along the way I’ll explain each concept in detail.

Scala has made some object-oriented innovations, and one of them is the `trait`. Traits are similar to abstract classes with partial implementation. 


# Building a Scala MongoDB driver: user stories

The user stories you’ll be implementing in your Scala wrapper driver are as follows:
- As a developer, I want an easier way to connect to my MongoDB server and access document databases.
- As a developer, I want to query and manage documents.


A great place to get a feel for MongoDB is http://try.mongodb.org. Go ahead and download MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Downloads).


If you’re interested in learning more about MongoDB, look at the MongoDB tutorial (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Tutorial).

We can run MongoDB on Docker:
```
docker pull mongo 
docker run -itd --name mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo –auth 
docker exec -it mongo mongo admin 
> db.createUser({ user:'admin',pwd:'123456',roles:[ { role:'userAdminAnyDatabase', db: 'admin'}]}); 
> db.auth('admin', '123456') 
```


# Classes and constructors
`Classes.scala`:
```scala
class MongoClient(val host: String, val port: Int)
```

Because all the constructor parameters are preceded by `val`, Scala will create immutable instance values for each of them. The following example creates an instance of a Mongo client and accesses its properties:
```scala
scala> val client = new MongoClient("127.0.0.1", 123)
client: MongoClient = MongoClient@10f7c76

scala> client.port
res3: Int = 123

scala> client.host
res5: String = 127.0.0.1
```

You can create classes without any class body. Creating a class like a JavaBean with only a getter and setter would be easy in Scala, as in the following:
```scala
scala> class AddressBean(var address1:String, var address2:String, city:String, zipCode:Int)
defined class AddressBean

scala> var localAddress = new AddressBean("230 43rd street", "", "Columbus", 43233)
localAddress: AddressBean = AddressBean@3a751535
```


- When parameters are prefixed with `var` , Scala creates mutable instance variables.
- The `val` and `var` prefixes are optional, and when both of them are missing, they’re treated as private instance values, not accessible to anyone outside the class.

```scala
scala> class MongoClient(host:String, port:Int)
defined class MongoClient

scala> val client = new MongoClient("localhost", 123)
client: MongoClient = MongoClient@18ed8b75

scala> client.host
              ^
       error: value host is not a member of MongoClient
```
Most of the time you’ll have MongoDB running on the localhost with default port `27017`.


Wouldn’t it be nice to have an additional zero-argument constructor that defaults the host and port number so you don’t have to specify them every time? How about this:

```scala
class MongoClient(val host:String, val port:Int) {
    def this() = this("127.0.0.1", 27017)
}
```

The following example creates a class called `MyScript.scala` that validates and prints the constructor input:
```scala
class MyScript(host: String) {
  require(host != null, "Have to provide host name")
  if (host == "127.0.0.1") println("host = localhost")
  else println(s"hosts = $host")
}
```


And now load `MyScript` into Scala REPL:
```scala
scala> :load MyScript.scala
args: Array[String] = Array()
Loading MyScript.scala...
defined class MyScript

scala> val s = new MyScript("127.0.0.1")
host = localhost
s: MyScript = MyScript@7381d6f0

scala> val s = new MyScript(null)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: Have to provide host name
  at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:340)
  ... 30 elided
```


# Packaging
A *package* is a special object that defines a set of member classes and objects. The Scala package lets you segregate code into logical groupings or namespaces so that they don’t conflict with each other.


You can still use the traditional Java approach and define `package` at the top of the Scala file, or use a scoping approach, as demonstrated in the following listing.

```scala
package com {
    package scalainaction {
        package mongo {
            import com.mongodb.Mongo
            class MongoClient(val host:String, val port:Int) {
                require(host != null, "You have to provide a host name")
                private val underlying = new Mongo(host, port)
                def this() = this("127.0.0.1", 27017)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here you’re creating the `com.scalainaction.mongo` package for the `MongoClient` class. The previous code is exactly equivalent to the following code, where you’re declaring the package in traditional Java style:
```scala
package com.scalainaction.mongo

import com.mongodb.Mongo

class MongoClient(val host: String, val port: Int) {
  require(host != null, "Your have to provide a host name")
  private val underlying = new Mongo(host, port)

  def this() = this("127.0.0.1", 27017)
}
```
You can also use curly braces with top-level package declarations like the following:
```scala
package com.scalainaction.mongo {
    import com.mongodb.Mongo
    class MongoClient(val host:String, val port:Int) {
        require(host != null, "You have to provide a host name")
        private val underlying = new Mongo(host, port)
        def this() = this("127.0.0.1", 27017)
    }
}
```


The most widely used way in Scala code bases is the traditional way of declaring a package at the top of the Scala file. The only large, open source project I know of that uses the package-scoping approach is the *Lift* web framework (http://liftweb.net).
