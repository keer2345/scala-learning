# Foreword
Scala is difficult to learn. And you may very well not like what you see when you get to the top.

By the time you reach the top, you’ll understand why those features exist, how they make your Scala programs better, and, more important, how they make you a more effective programmer. You’ll still be sore from the bumps along the way but that pain will help you remember the lessons learned. You may even find yourself happily and productively working full-time in Scala for years to come!
