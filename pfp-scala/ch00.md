# Preface
Scala is a hybrid language that mixes both the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) paradigms.


**Cats**

Sooner rather than later you will come across the [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats) library and its awesome documentation. You might start using it in your projects, once you get familiar with the power of typeclasses such as **`Functor`, `Monad`** and **`Traverse`**. I am suere you will love it!

**Cats Effect**

As you evolve into a functional programmer, you will learn about purely functional effects and referential transparency. You might even start using the **`IO`** Monad given by [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect)

**Fs2**

One day you will need to process to a lot of data that doesn't fit into memory, a good solution to this development problem is to use streaming. While searching for a useful candidate, you might stumble upon a purely functional streaming library: [Fs2](https://fs2.io). Then you will quickly learn that Fs2 is also a great library for control flow.

**Database** or **Cache**

- PostgreSQL
- ElasticSearch
- Redis

# Dependency versions
```scala
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.0"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    compilerPlugin("org.typelevel" %% "kind-projector" % "0.11.0" cross CrossVersion.full),
    "org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % "2.0.0",
    "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "2.0.0",
    "dev.profunktor" %% "console4cats" % "0.8.0",
    "io.estatico" %% "newtype" % "0.4.3",
    "eu.timepit" %% "refined" % "0.9.10"
)

scalacOptions += "-Ymacro-annotations"
```
The `sbt-tpolecat` plugin is also necessary. Here is a minimal `plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("io.github.davidgregory084" % "sbt-tpolecat" % "0.1.6")
```
# Prerequisites

This book is considered intermediate to advanced. Familiarity with functional programming concepts and basic FP libraries such as *Cats* and *Cats Effect* will be of tremendous help even though I will do my best to be as clear and concise as I can.


Recommended sources for learning these concepts are the Scala with *Cats* book and the *Cats Effect* official documentation:
- https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/
- https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/


The following list details the topics required to understand this book:
