**Chapter 00 Preface**

# Requirements
- JDK 8
- Scala
- Sbt

# Create a project
## Hello World
```
> sbt new scala/hello-world.g8

> cd hello-world
> touch src/main/scala/org/learningconcurrency/HelloWorld.scala
```


```scala
package org.learningconcurrency

object HelloWorld extends App {
  println("Hello, world!!!")
}
```
```
> run
[info] running org.learningconcurrency.HelloWorld 
Hello, world!!!
```

## Specify Software Repositories
Specify software repositories with [resolvers](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Resolvers.html), this is **optional**.


We add the following lines to our `build.sbt` file:
```
resolvers ++= Seq(
    "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at
        "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots",
    "Sonatype OSS Releases" at
        "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases",
    "Typesafe Repository" at
        "http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"
)
```

Add library:

```
libraryDependencies += "commons-io" % "commons-io" % "2.6"
```

After changing the `build.sbt` file, it is necessary to `reload` any running SBT instances in the SBT interactive shell:
```
> reload
```
