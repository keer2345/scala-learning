**Chapter 17 [HTTP API with http4s](https://livebook.manning.com/book/get-programming-with-scala/chapter-17/v-4/1)**

> mbvoahro@sharklasers.com

After reading this lesson, you will be able to:
- Run an HTTP server using SBT
- Implement an API to handle GET requests

In this lesson, I’ll introduce you to `http4s`, a popular library to manage HTTP requests and responses. Finally, you’ll see how to run it using SBT. In the capstone, you’ll use `http4s` to create an HTTP server and define its API.

# 17.1  An overview of http4s
[**_Typelevel_**](https://typelevel.org/) is a non-profit organization to promote purely functional open source Scala projects together with an inclusive and welcoming environment.

[**_http4s_**](https://http4s.org/) is a Typelevel project and one of the most popular Scala libraries to handle HTTP requests and responses. Even though http4s does offer a giter8 template (have a look at the sidebar for more information), in this lesson, I’ll show you how to build your HTTP server from scratch.


A GITER8 TEMPLATE FOR HTTP4S:
```
sbt new http4s/http4s.g8
```
```
cd quickstart
sbt run
```
```
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello/scala
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 29 May 2018 15:24:52 GMT
Content-Length: 26

{"message":"Hello, scala"}
```

Summary of the main components of an http4s application. An HttpService[IO] matches a request, and it produces a response wrapped around an IO instance to represent possible side effects. A StreamApp[IO] uses a BlazeBuilder instance to bind to a given port and host and to mount multiple instances of HttpService[IO] to define the API of an HTTP server.

**OTHER HTTP SCALA LIBRARIES**

The Scala ecosystem has a few HTTP libraries: a few possible alternatives to `http4s` are following:
- `Akka-Http` (see https://github.com/akka/akka-http) is an open source project maintained by Lightbend, a company that offers commercial support for it and many other products. It is implemented using Akka Streams and Akka Actors, and it provides low-level and high-level APIs for HTTP processing in Scala and Java: its documentation is available at [doc.akka.io](https://akka.io/docs/). It also offers a giter8 template: more information at https://github.com/akka/akka-http-quickstart-scala.g8.
- `Finch` (see https://github.com/finagle/finch) is another open source project developed by Twitter. It is a purely functional library that provides a combinatory API. It also has complete and comprehensive documentation at https://finagle.github.io/finch. At the time of this writing, it doesn’t have a giter8 template but it has a quickstart project on GitHub to clone and use a skeleton for your service: you can find it at https://github.com/zdavep/finch-quickstart.


# 17.2   A Ping Server using http4s
## 17.2.1   Initial Setup
[logback](https://logback.qos.ch) is a popular Java library that allows you to customize the behavior and appearance of your logs via a configuration file, usually called `logback.xml`
