# Public, the Default Access Modifier
```scala
class Party {
  var attendees = 0

  def register(guests: Int) =
    attendees += guests
}
```

# Private
In Scala, you use the `private` access modifier to prevent access to functions, values, and classes that should not be used publicly: when a code element is `private`, you can only access it from inside its class.
```scala
class Party {
  private var attendees = 0

  def register(guests: Int) =
    attendees += guests
}
```

# Protected
A `protected` code element is accessible only from its class and its subclasses. Let’s see how you could use the protected access modifier to control the access to the function computing the cost estimation of an event:
```scala
class Event {

  protected def estimateCosts(attendees: Int): Double =
    if (attendees < 10) 50.00 else attendees * 12.34
}

class Party extends Event {

  private var attendees = 0

  var cost = estimateCosts(attendees)

  def register(guests: Int) =
    attendees += guests
}
```
# Which Access Modifier to use?
Comparing access modifiers in Scala. By default, a code element is public, in other words, you can access it from everywhere. When private, you can access it from its class. When protected, you can access it from its class and subclasses.
