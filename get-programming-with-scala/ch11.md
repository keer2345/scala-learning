In Scala, you can create singletons using objects elegantly and concisely. You are also encouraged to make a clear separation between static and non-static methods: the non-static ones act on a specific instance of a class, while the static ones belong to its general definition. In Scala, you implement non-static methods in a class and static methods in an object. In the capstone, you’ll use an object to define the main entry point of your application.

# Object
```scala
object Vocabulary {

  val sentenceA = "Hi there!"
  val sentenceB = "Welcome!"
  val sentenceC = "What's up bro"
}

Vocabulary.sentenceA
Vocabulary.sentenceB
```

The comparison between implementing a singleton in Java, JavaScript and Scala: I am confident you will appreciate the simplicity of the Scala implementation:
```java
// Java
public class MySingleton {
   private static MySingleton instance = null;
 
   protected MySingleton() {}
 
   public static MySingleton getInstance() {
      if(instance == null) {
         instance = new ClassicSingleton();
      }
      return instance;
   }
}
```
```javascript
// JavaScript
var MySingleton = (function () {
     var instance;
  
     function createInstance() {
         var object = new Object("my-instance");
         return object;
     }
  
     return {
         getInstance: function () {
             if (!instance) {
                 instance = createInstance();
             }
             return instance;
         }
     };
 })();
```
```scala
// Scala -> only 2 words!!!
object MySingleton
```

# Executable Object
```scala
object HelloWorld {
 
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello world!")
  }
}
```

# Companion Object
In Scala, a **_companion object_** is an object that has the same name as another existing class.
```scala
abstract class Robot(name: String) {

  def welcome: String
}

object Robot {
  def mostTalkative(r1: Robot, r2: Robot): Robot = {
    val r1Size = r1.welcome.length
    val r2Size = r2.welcome.length
    if (r1Size >= r2Size) r1 else r2
  }
}
```


```scala
val tom = new Robot("Tom") {
  def welcome = Vocabulary.sentenceA
}
val bob = new Robot("Bob") {
  def welcome = Vocabulary.sentenceB
}
Robot.mostTalkative(tom, bob)
```

# The Apply Method
In lesson 7, you have learned that a class can have one constructor and you can use it by using the keyword `new.` What if you want to specify different ways of creating a class? How can you do it with only one constructor? The `apply` function of a companion object can help in solving your problem.
```scala
class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

  object Person {

    def apply(p1: Person, p2: Person): Person = {
      val name = s"Son of ${p1.name} and ${p2.name}"
      val age = 0
      new Person(name, age)
    }
  }
```

Once you have defined an apply method, you can use it in the same way as any other static method implemented in the companion object. You can declare multiple `apply` methods in the companion object, as long as their function signature is uniquely identifiable by the compiler. Consider the following snippet of code:
```scala
object Person {

  def apply(name: String): Person = new Person(name, 0)

  def apply(age: Int): Person = new Person("Mr Unknown", age)

}
```
```scala
val tom = new Person("Tom", 24)
val bob = new Person("Bob", 23)

Person.apply(tom, bob)
Person(tom, bob)
```
