- Concise syntax
- Flexibility
- Concurrency
- BIg DAta and spark

# Scala and the JVM
Comparison between the execution of a Java program with a Scala one. The Java source code has extension *.java, and javac translates it into bytecode files with extension *.class. You save Scala code in files with extension *.scala, and scalac is the compiler responsible for converting them into bytecode. The JVM is now ready to run the bytecode, usually conveniently grouped in a *.jar file.
