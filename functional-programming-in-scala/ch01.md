**Chapter 1 What is functional programming?**

**Functional programming ( FP )** is based on a simple premise with far-reaching implications: we construct our programs using only pure functions -- in other words, functions that have no *side effects*.

What are side effects? A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a result, for example:
- Modifying a variable
- Modifying a data structure in place
- Setting a field on an object
- Throwing an exception or halting with an error
- Printing to the console or reading user input
- Reading from or writing to a file
- Drawing on the screen

We’ll learn how following the discipline of FP is tremendously beneficial because of the increase in modularity that we gain from programming with pure functions. Because of their modularity, pure functions are easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generalize, and reason about. Furthermore, pure functions are much less prone to bugs.

In this chapter, we’ll look at a simple program with side effects and demonstrate some of the benefits of FP by removing these side effects. We’ll also discuss the benefits of FP more generally and define two important concepts:
- referential transparency
- the substitution model

# The benefits of FP: a simple example
## A program with side effects
A Scala program with side effects:
```scala
class Cafe {
    def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard): Coffee = {
        val cup = new Coffee()
        cc.charge(cup.price)
        cup
    }
}
```
Adding a payments object:
```scala
class Cafe {
    def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard, p: Payments): Coffee = {
        val cup = new Coffee()
        p.charge(cc, cup.price)
        cup
    }
}
```
