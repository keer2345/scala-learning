**2. Getting started with functional programming in Scala**

> nqftjjpp【】sharklasers.com

We'll discuss how to write loops using **_tail recursive function_**, and we'll introduce **_higher-order functions (HOFs)_**. HOFs are functions that take other functions as arguments and may themselves return functions as their output. We’ll also look at some examples of polymorphic HOFs where we use types to guide us toward an implementation.

# 2.1. Introducing Scala the language: an example
```scala
object MyModule {
  def abs(n: Int): Int = {
    if (n < 0) -n
    else n
  }
  
  private def formatAbs(x:Int)={
    val msg = "The absolute value of %d is %d"
    msg.format(x, abs(x))
  }
  
  def main(args:Array[String]):Unit = {
    println(formatAbs(-42))
  }
}
```

# 2.2. Running our program
```
> scalac MyModule.scala
> scala MyModule
The absolute value of -42 is 42.
```

or
```
> scala MyModule.scala
The absolute value of -42 is 42.
```

We can load our source file into the REPL and try things out (your actual console output may differ slightly):
```scala
> scala
Welcome to Scala.
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :load MyModule.scala	
Loading MyModule.scala...
defined module MyModule

scala> MyModule.abs(-42)	
res0: Int = 42	
```

It’s also possible to copy and paste individual lines of code into the REPL. It even has a paste mode (accessed with the :paste command) designed to paste code that spans multiple lines. It’s a good idea to get familiar with the REPL and its features because it’s a tool that you’ll use a lot as a Scala programmer.

# 2.3. Modules, objects, and namespaces
```scala
scala> import MyModule.abs
import MyModule.abs

scala> abs(-42)
res0: 42
```
```scala
import MyModule._
```

# 2.4. Higher-order functions: passing functions to functions
## 2.4.1. A short detour: writing loops functionally
```scala
def factorial(n: Int): Int = {
  @annotation.tailrec
  def go(n: Int, acc: Int): Int = {
    if (n <= 0) acc
    else go(n - 1, n * acc)
  }

  go(n, 1)
}
```

## 2.4.2. Writing our first higher-order function
```scala
object MyModule {
  // ...	
  private def formatAbs(x: Int) = {
    val msg = "The absolute value of %d is %d."
    msg.format(x, abs(x))
  }

  private def formatFactorial(n: Int) = {
    val msg = "The factorial of %d is %d."
    msg.format(n, factorial(n))
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(formatAbs(-42))
    println(formatFactorial(7))
  }
}
```

```scala
def formatResult(name: String, n: Int, f: Int => Int) = {	
  val msg = "The %s of %d is %d."
  msg.format(name, n, f(n))
}
```



```scala
scala> formatResult("absolute value", -42, abs)
res0: String = "The absolute value of -42 is 42."

scala> formatResult("factorial", 7, factorial)
res1: String = "The factorial of 7 is 5040."
```

# 2.5. Polymorphic functions: abstracting over types
## 2.5.1. An example of a polymorphic function

Monomorphic function to find a String in an array:
```scala
// First, a findFirst, specialized to `String`.
// Ideally, we could generalize this to work for any `Array` type.
def findFirst(ss: Array[String], key: String): Int = {
  @annotation.tailrec
  def loop(n: Int): Int =
    // If `n` is past the end of the array, return `-1`
    // indicating the key doesn't exist in the array.
    if (n >= ss.length) -1
    // `ss(n)` extracts the n'th element of the array `ss`.
    // If the element at `n` is equal to the key, return `n`
    // indicating that the element appears in the array at that index.
    else if (ss(n) == key) n
    else loop(n + 1) // Otherwise increment `n` and keep looking.
  // Start the loop at the first element of the array.
  loop(0)
}
```
Polymorphic function to find an element in an array:
```scala
// Here's a polymorphic version of `findFirst`, parameterized on
// a function for testing whether an `A` is the element we want to find.
// Instead of hard-coding `String`, we take a type `A` as a parameter.
// And instead of hard-coding an equality check for a given key,
// we take a function with which to test each element of the array.
def findFirst[A](as: Array[A], p: A => Boolean): Int = {
  @annotation.tailrec
  def loop(n: Int): Int =
    if (n >= as.length) -1
    // If the function `p` matches the current element,
    // we've found a match and we return its index in the array.
    else if (p(as(n))) n
    else loop(n + 1)

  loop(0)
}
```

## 2.5.2. Calling HOFs with anonymous functions

We can test the findFirst function in the REPL as follows:
```scala
scala> findFirst(Array(7, 9, 13), (x: Int) => x == 9)
res2: Int = 1
```

**FUNCTIONS AS VALUES IN SCALA**

When we define a function literal, what is actually being defined in Scala is an object with a method called `apply`. Scala has a special rule for this method name, so that objects that have an `apply` method can be called as if they were themselves methods. When we define a function literal like `(a, b) => a < b`, this is really syntactic sugar for object creation:
```scala
val lessThan = new Function2[Int, Int, Boolean] {
  def apply(a: Int, b: Int) = a < b
}
```



```scala
scala> val b = lessThan.apply(10, 20)
b: Boolean = true
```

# 2.6. Following types to implementations
```scala
// Exercise: Implement a polymorphic function to check whether
// an `Array[A]` is sorted
def isSorted[A](as: Array[A], gt: (A,A) => Boolean): Boolean = {
  @annotation.tailrec
  def go(n: Int): Boolean =
    if (n >= as.length-1) true
    else if (gt(as(n), as(n+1))) false
    else go(n+1)

  go(0)
}
```

```scala
// Polymorphic functions are often so constrained by their type
// that they only have one implementation! Here's an example:

def partial1[A,B,C](a: A, f: (A,B) => C): B => C =
  (b: B) => f(a, b)

// Exercise: Implement `curry`.
// Note that `=>` associates to the right, so we could
// write the return type as `A => B => C`
def curry[A,B,C](f: (A, B) => C): A => (B => C) =
  a => b => f(a, b)


// NB: The `Function2` trait has a `curried` method already

// Exercise: Implement `uncurry`
def uncurry[A,B,C](f: A => B => C): (A, B) => C =
  (a, b) => f(a)(b)

/*
NB: There is a method on the `Function` object in the standard library,
`Function.uncurried` that you can use for uncurrying.
Note that we can go back and forth between the two forms. We can curry
and uncurry and the two forms are in some sense "the same". In FP jargon,
we say that they are _isomorphic_ ("iso" = same; "morphe" = shape, form),
a term we inherit from category theory.
*/

// Exercise: Implement `compose`

def compose[A,B,C](f: B => C, g: A => B): A => C =
  a => f(g(a))
```
