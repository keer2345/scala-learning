# A language that grows on you
```scala
var capital = Map("US" -> "Washington", "France" -> "Paris")
capital += ("Japan" -> "Tokyo")
println(capital("France"))
```


**Growing new types**
```scala
def factorial(x: BigInt): BigInt =
    if (x == 0) 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)
```
```scala
scala> factorial(30)
res4: BigInt = 265252859812191058636308480000000
```

Scala allows users to grow and adapt the language in the directions they need by defining easy-to-use libraries that feel like native language support.

**Growing new control constructs**
