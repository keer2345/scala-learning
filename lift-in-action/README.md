* Lift in Action

- Getting started
    - [Introducing Lift](ch01.md): this chapter starts by introducing both Scala and Lift concepts, complete with
high-level explanations and samples. The aim is to give you grounding in what is
a fundamentally different way of thinking. 
    - [Hello Lift](ch02.md): youâ€™ll be building upon
the basis laid down in chapter 1 by constructing your very first Hello World
application, which will involve the most basic Lift steps.
