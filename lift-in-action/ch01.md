**Chapter 1 Introducing Lift**


This chapter covers
- An overview of Scala and Lift
- Lift’s history and design rationale
- An overview of Lift’s structure


Lift is built atop the powerful functional programming language Scala, which lends itself to writing exceedingly concise but powerful code. By leveraging Scala, Lift aims to be expressive and elegant while stressing the importance of maintainability, scalability, and performance.


If you want to get serious with Scala, I highly recommend looking at the other Scala titles published by Manning: 
- *Scala in Action* by NilanjanRaychaudhuri
- *Scala in Depth* by Joshua Suereth

# What is Scala?
# What is Lift?

- [Lift](http://liftweb.net/) is a sophisticated web framework for building rich, vibrant applications.
- Lift is a set of well-maintained Scala libraries that are used by many other projects within the broader Scala ecosystem.


Lift aims to make building real-time, highly interactive, and massively scalable applications easier than it has ever been by supporting advanced features like Comet, which allow you to push data to the browser when it’s needed, without the user having to make any kind of request for it.

## Lift design goals
